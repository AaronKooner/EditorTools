# Sublime Text 3 - KOS Syntax Highlighting

This Syntax Definition was ported from [xeger's Atom package](https://github.com/KSP-KOS/EditorTools/tree/develop/Atom).  Modifications to regex searches for strings and comments were take from [pacology's ST3 definition](https://gist.github.com/pacology/04242985174cc18f7b02#file-kos-yaml-tmlanguage) for kOS.

To install the kOS definition as is, place the `kOS.tmlLanguage` file your **user** package directory.  You can find this directory by opening Sublime Text and selecting the following:

> Preferences > Browse Packages

The User folder will be among the listed directories.


## Customizations

If you wish to make alternations or additions to the definition, you can use [PackageDev](https://github.com/SublimeText/PackageDev) along with the `kOS.YAML-tmlLanguage` file to create your own version.  An overview of creating syntax definition in Sublime Text can be [found here](http://docs.sublimetext.info/en/latest/extensibility/syntaxdefs.html).
